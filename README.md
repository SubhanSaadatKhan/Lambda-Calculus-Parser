# Lambda Calculus Parser using Haskell

Haskell was used to create an interpreter that parses a string into the data types offered by Builder.hs and Lambda.hs. Using this, we are able to generate Lambda Calculus expressions, which we can then normalize into a streamlined but equivalent expression (expression evaluation).

This undertaking aims to demonstrate lambda calculus as a method of computation and apply the acquired skills to a practical task (parsing).
- EffectivelyÂ  Use functional programming and parsing
- Be familiar with and able to apply core functional programming principles (HOF, pure functions, immutable data structures, abstractions).
Implement non-trivial programs using Haskell and lambda calculus

This increased knowledge of Haskell, functional programming, and their applications, as well as lambda calculus.
